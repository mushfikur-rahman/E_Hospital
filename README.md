# E_Hospital -Health Checker 

## Introduction
The E_Hospital Health Checker is a Java application designed to provide users with an overall idea of their fitness condition. By taking inputs such as height, weight, body temperature, and blood pressure values, the system calculates BMI and assesses the user's health risk. It offers advice based on the condition and suggests when to seek medical attention. Additionally, users can book visiting times and dates through the system.

## Application
1. The E_Hospital Health Checker app is beneficial for daily use, offering users insights into their overall fitness condition.
2. It provides instant health condition checks, making it useful for people concerned about their well-being.
3. The app can detect fever and trace blood pressure conditions, facilitating the early detection of any serious health issues.
4. In rural areas with limited access to medical knowledge, the app can be particularly useful due to its user-friendly interface.
